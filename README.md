# Frontend candidate testing
Hello,
To validate your technical level, we need you to make a very simple technical Exo.

## The goal
this technical EXO is to know if you have the minimum level to join the team.
The Exo, a game Questions / Answers.
An Front-end that allows to load 1 question and 2 answers in the form of JSON

### Data (array or object of your choice)
- Do you like React? (Question)
- Good choice ! (Reply)
- Damn ! (Reply)

### Playing the game under React and TypeScript
- Do you like React? (Choice Yes / No)
If yes
- Show the answer: Good choice!
If not

To return **the github link** for the end of the week
Best regards
